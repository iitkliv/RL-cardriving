 cleaner way to handle file open/close and avoid memory leaks:

Prep:

import numpy as np
import h5py

data_to_write = np.random.random(size=(100,20)) # or some such
Write:

with h5py.File('name-of-file.h5', 'w') as hf:
    hf.create_dataset("name-of-dataset",  data=data_to_write)
Read:

with h5py.File('name-of-file.h5', 'r') as hf:
    data = hf['name-of-dataset'][:]
